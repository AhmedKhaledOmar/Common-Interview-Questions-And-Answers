## **OOP:**
### Q- What is OOP?

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm or style of programming that is based on the concept of "objects" which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.

In OOP, a program is designed by creating classes, which are like blueprints or templates for creating objects. Each class defines a set of attributes (also known as properties or data members) and methods (functions or procedures) that can be used to manipulate those attributes.

An object is an instance of a class, and it contains specific data values for each of its attributes. The methods defined in the class can be used to manipulate the data within the object.

OOP provides several benefits, including code reusability, encapsulation, and the ability to model real-world objects and concepts more accurately. It is widely used in software development, and many popular programming languages, such as Java, Python, and C++, support OOP principles.

**Ù’Note** : In short anything in my project I treat it as an object

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  Q- What is OOP Types ?
In C#, there are four main types of OOP. These are:

1-Abstraction
2-Encapsulation
3-Inheritance
4-Polymorphism
Here's a brief explanation of each:

Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details while exposing only the essential features of an object. It is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated but can be used as a base class for other classes. An interface is a contract that specifies a set of methods and properties that a class must implement. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity and increase maintainability of the code.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data and methods into a single unit (i.e. class) and restricting access to the data from outside the class. It helps to achieve data integrity and security by preventing unauthorized access or modification of the data. Encapsulation in C# is achieved through the use of access modifiers such as public, private, protected, and internal.

Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating new classes that are derived from existing classes. The new class, called the derived class, inherits all the properties and methods of the existing class, called the base class. This enables code reuse and promotes code efficiency. In C#, inheritance is achieved using the "class : baseclass" syntax.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In C#, there are two types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism and run-time polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, while run-time polymorphism is achieved through method overriding.

Method overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name, but with different parameters. This helps to avoid naming conflicts and improves code readability. Method overriding, on the other hand, enables a derived class to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.

In conclusion, these four types of OOP principles are crucial in designing efficient and maintainable software systems in C#. Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism help to achieve code reusability, code efficiency, and maintainability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation?
Abstraction and Encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that are often confused with each other, but they are different in terms of their meaning and implementation.

Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details while exposing only the essential features of an object. It is achieved by defining abstract classes and interfaces that define the contract for the behavior of the object, without specifying how the behavior is implemented. Abstraction provides a way to represent complex systems in a simplified manner, allowing developers to focus on the most important aspects of the system. It helps to reduce complexity and increase maintainability of the code.

On the other hand, Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data and methods into a single unit (i.e. class) and restricting access to the data from outside the class. It helps to achieve data integrity and security by preventing unauthorized access or modification of the data. Encapsulation ensures that the implementation details of a class are hidden from other objects, providing a clear separation between the interface and the implementation.

In summary, the key difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation is that Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary details and providing a simplified view of the object, while Encapsulation focuses on hiding the implementation details and providing a clear separation between the interface and the implementation. Both Abstraction and Encapsulation are important principles in OOP that help to achieve code reusability, code efficiency, and maintainability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's dynamic polymarphism?
Dynamic Polymorphism, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows an object to take on many forms at runtime. It is achieved through method overriding, which enables a derived class to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.

In dynamic polymorphism, the specific implementation of a method to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, rather than its declared type. This means that a method call on an object of a derived class can result in different behavior than the same method call on an object of its base class.

Dynamic polymorphism is a powerful feature in OOP that allows developers to create code that is more flexible, reusable, and extensible. It enables the creation of a generic code that can work with multiple objects, without knowing their specific types. Dynamic polymorphism is particularly useful in situations where the exact type of an object is not known at compile time, but is determined at runtime.

In C#, dynamic polymorphism is achieved through the use of the virtual and override keywords. The base class declares a method as virtual, and the derived class overrides the method by providing its own implementation. When a method call is made on an object of the derived class, the overridden method is called instead of the virtual method defined in the base class

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - Difference between overloading and override?
n C#, both method overloading and method overriding are used to achieve polymorphism, but they are different concepts.

Method overloading is a feature that allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters. Overloading a method means defining a method with the same name as an existing method but with a different signature. The method signature includes the method name, parameter types, and the number of parameters. Overloading allows you to create methods that perform similar tasks, but with different input parameters. The method that is called at runtime is determined based on the number, types, and order of the arguments passed to the method.

Here's an example of method overloading in C#:

<pre>
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double Add(double a, double b) //return type dosn't effect in this proccess
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Calculator class has two Add methods, one that takes two int parameters, and the other that takes two double parameters. The methods have the same name but different parameter types, and the appropriate method is called based on the argument types passed to the method.

Method overriding, on the other hand, is a feature that allows you to provide a new implementation for a method that is already defined in a base class or an interface. Overriding a method means providing a new implementation of a method with the same signature as the original method. The method in the derived class must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the base class method.

Here's an example of method overriding in C#:

<pre>
public class Shape
{
    public virtual double CalculateArea()
    {
        return 0;
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public override double CalculateArea() //return type dosn't effect in this proccess
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Shape class has a virtual CalculateArea method, which returns 0. The Circle class overrides the CalculateArea method and provides its own implementation to calculate the area of a circle. The override keyword is used to indicate that the CalculateArea method in the Circle class is overriding the CalculateArea method in the Shape class.

To avoid errors during compilation, the compiler checks that the method being overridden has the same signature as the overriding method. This means that the method name, return type, and parameter types must match. If the signature does not match, the compiler will generate an error.

In summary, method overloading is used to create multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types, while method overriding is used to provide a new implementation for a method that is already defined in a base class or an interface. Both concepts are used to achieve polymorphism in C#.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's Access Modifer? 
Access modifiers in C# are keywords that determine the visibility and accessibility of classes, properties, methods, and other members in a program. In C#, there are five access modifiers:

public: Public members are accessible from any part of the program. A public member can be accessed from the same assembly or from a different assembly.
Example:

<pre>
public class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Name and Age properties are declared as public, which means they can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

private: Private members are accessible only within the same class. Private members are not visible from outside the class.
Example:

<pre>
public class Employee
{
    private int salary;

    public void SetSalary(int amount)
    {
        salary = amount;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the salary field is declared as private, which means it can be accessed only from within the Employee class.

protected: Protected members are accessible within the same class and any derived classes. Protected members are not visible from outside the class hierarchy.
Example:

<pre>
public class Shape
{
    protected double area;

    protected virtual void CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate area of the shape
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public void DisplayArea()
    {
        CalculateArea();
        Console.WriteLine($"Area: {area}");
    }

    protected override void CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate area of the circle
        area = Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }

    public double Radius { get; set; }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Shape class has a protected area field and a protected virtual CalculateArea method. The Circle class inherits from the Shape class and overrides the CalculateArea method to calculate the area of a circle. The area field is accessible from within the Circle class, but not from outside the class hierarchy.

internal: Internal members are accessible only within the same assembly. An assembly is a collection of one or more modules that are built as a unit.
Example:

<pre>
internal class Calculator // Can read any class in any class has same namespace
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Calculator class is declared as internal, which means it can be accessed only from within the same assembly.

protected internal: Protected internal members are accessible within the same assembly and any derived classes.
Example:

<pre>
public class Shape
{
    protected internal double area;

    protected internal virtual void CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate area of the shape
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public void DisplayArea()
    {
        CalculateArea();
        Console.WriteLine($"Area: {area}");
    }

    protected internal override void CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate area of the circle
        area = Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }

    public double Radius { get; set; }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Shape class has a protected internal area field and a protected internal virtual CalculateArea method. The Circle class inherits from the Shape class and overrides the CalculateArea method to calculate the area of a circle. The area field is accessible from within the Circle class and any other class within the same assembly, but not from outside the assembly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What is Non-Access Modifer? 
Non-access modifiers are keywords in C# that modify the behavior of classes, methods, and other members in a program, but do not affect their accessibility or visibility. In C#, there are four non-access modifiers:

static: The static modifier is used to create a single instance of a member that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Static members belong to the class itself, not to any particular instance of the class.
Example:

<pre>
public class MathUtils
{
    public static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Add method is declared as static, which means it can be accessed without creating an instance of the MathUtils class.

abstract: The abstract modifier is used to define an abstract class or an abstract method. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly and can only be used as a base class for other classes. An abstract method does not have an implementation and must be overridden in a derived class.
Example:

<pre>
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double Area { get; }

    public abstract void Display();
}
</pre>
In this example, the Shape class is declared as abstract, which means it cannot be instantiated directly. The Area and Display methods are declared as abstract, which means they do not have an implementation and must be overridden in any derived class.

sealed: The sealed modifier is used to prevent a class from being inherited by other classes. Sealed classes cannot be used as a base class for other classes.
Example:
<pre>
public sealed class Circle
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Circle class is declared as sealed, which means it cannot be inherited by any other class.

virtual: The virtual modifier is used to allow a method to be overridden in a derived class. A virtual method has an implementation in the base class, but can be overridden in a derived class.
Example:
<pre>
public class Shape
{
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        // Draw the shape
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        // Draw a circle
    }
}

public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        // Draw a rectangle
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Shape class has a virtual Draw method, which has an implementation in the base class. The Circle and Rectangle classes override the Draw method to provide their own implementations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q -  new key with method in class ?
In C#, the new keyword is used to declare a member in a derived class that has the same name as a member in the base class. This is called "hiding" the base class member, and it allows the derived class to have its own implementation of the member that is independent of the base class.

Here's an example:

<pre>
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The animal is eating.");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public new void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The cat is eating.");
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Animal class has an Eat method that writes a message to the console. The Cat class also has an Eat method that writes a message to the console, but it is declared with the new keyword to hide the base class Eat method.

Now, if we create an instance of the Cat class and call the Eat method, we'll see the message from the Cat class:
<pre>
Cat myCat = new Cat();
myCat.Eat(); // Output: The cat is eating.
//If we cast the Cat instance to an Animal instance and call the Eat method, we'll see the message from the Animal class, 
//because the new keyword only affects the member in the derived class, not the base class:
Animal myAnimal = (Animal)myCat;
myAnimal.Eat(); // Output: The animal is eating.
</pre>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q -  Different between access and non-access modifier ?
In C#, access modifiers are used to control the accessibility or visibility of classes, methods, fields, properties, and other members in a program, while non-access modifiers modify the behavior of these members without affecting their accessibility.

Access modifiers determine who can access a member and from where, while non-access modifiers determine how a member behaves and what it can do.

Here are some differences between access and non-access modifiers:

Accessibility: Access modifiers control the accessibility of a member, while non-access modifiers do not.

Visibility: Access modifiers control where a member can be accessed from (e.g. within the same class, within the same assembly, or from any assembly), while non-access modifiers do not affect visibility.

Inheritance: Access modifiers can affect the inheritance of a member, such as when a member is marked as private and cannot be accessed by derived classes. Non-access modifiers do not affect inheritance.

Behavior: Non-access modifiers modify the behavior of a member, such as when a method is marked as static and can be called without an instance of the class. Access modifiers do not modify behavior.

Examples of access modifiers include public, private, protected, and internal. Examples of non-access modifiers include static, virtual, abstract, and sealed.

In general, access modifiers are used to control who can access a member, while non-access modifiers are used to modify the behavior of a member. Together, access and non-access modifiers allow developers to control the accessibility and behavior of members in a program, making it easier to create robust and maintainable software.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q -  When inhertance child class from paret class and override mehthod any method call at first when call parent class or when class child class ?
When a child class inherits from a parent class and overrides a method, the method that is called depends on the type of the object that the method is called on. If the object is an instance of the child class, the overridden method in the child class is called. If the object is an instance of the parent class, the method in the parent class is called.

Here's an example:
<pre>
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The cat meows.");
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Animal class has a Speak method that writes a message to the console. The Cat class overrides the Speak method with its own implementation.

Now, if we create an instance of the Cat class and call the Speak method, we'll see the message from the Cat class:
<pre>
Cat myCat = new Cat();
myCat.Speak(); // Output: The cat meows.
If we cast the Cat instance to an Animal instance and call the Speak method, we'll still see the message from the Cat class, because the override keyword overrides the base class method and replaces it with the derived class method:
</pre>
<pre>
Animal myAnimal = (Animal)myCat;
myAnimal.Speak(); // Output: The cat meows.
</pre>
However, if we create an instance of the Animal class and call the Speak method, we'll see the message from the Animal class, because the override keyword only affects the method in the derived class, not the base class:

<pre>
Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
myAnimal.Speak(); // Output: The animal makes a sound.
</pre>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q -  Different between singelton and static class?
Singleton and static classes are two different design patterns in C# that are used to create classes that have only one instance in memory. However, they have some differences in implementation and behavior.

A singleton class is a class that can only have one instance in memory at any given time. It is created using a private constructor and a static method to retrieve the single instance. Singleton classes are often used for classes that manage system resources or have global state.

Here's an example of a singleton class:
<pre>
public class MySingleton
{
    private static MySingleton _instance;

    private MySingleton()
    {
        // Constructor is private so that instances cannot be created outside the class
    }

    public static MySingleton GetInstance()
    {
        if (_instance == null)
        {
            _instance = new MySingleton();
        }
        return _instance;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the MySingleton class has a private constructor, which prevents instances of the class from being created outside the class. The GetInstance method is a static method that returns the single instance of the class, creating it if necessary.

On the other hand, a static class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members, such as methods and fields. Static classes are often used for utility classes that provide common functionality to other classes.

Here's an example of a static class:
<pre>
public static class MyStaticClass
{
    public static void MyStaticMethod()
    {
        // Static method implementation
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the MyStaticClass class is marked as static, which means it cannot be instantiated. It contains a single static method that can be called from other classes without creating an instance of the class.

So, the main differences between a singleton class and a static class are:

A singleton class can be instantiated and can have state, while a static class cannot be instantiated and cannot have state.
A singleton class is used to control the creation and access to a single instance of a class, while a static class is used to provide utility methods and constants.
It's important to choose the right design pattern based on the needs of your application, as both singleton and static classes have their own benefits and drawbacks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q -  Different between interface and abstract? and what's new in C# about it ?
In C#, interfaces and abstract classes are two different ways to define a contract for derived classes to implement. They have some similarities, but also some important differences.

An interface is a type that defines a set of public methods, properties, events, and indexers that a class must implement. An interface does not provide any implementation details, only the definition of the members that a class must implement. An interface can be used to define a common contract for multiple classes, even if those classes have different base classes.

Here's an example of an interface:
<pre>
public interface IShape
{
    double CalculateArea();
    double CalculatePerimeter();
}
</pre>
In this example, the IShape interface defines two methods that a class must implement to be considered a shape. Any class that implements this interface must provide its own implementation for these methods.

An abstract class, on the other hand, is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract and non-abstract members. An abstract class provides a partial implementation of a class, leaving some of the implementation details to derived classes. An abstract class can be used to define a common base for multiple classes, and can contain state and behavior that is shared by all derived classes.

Here's an example of an abstract class:
<pre>
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
    public abstract double CalculatePerimeter();

    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        // Default implementation of Draw method
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the Shape class is marked as abstract, which means it cannot be instantiated. It defines two abstract methods that must be implemented by any derived classes, but also provides a default implementation of a Draw method. Derived classes can override the Draw method if they need to provide their own implementation.

As for what's new in C# about interfaces and abstract classes, in C# 8.0 and later, interfaces can now contain default implementations for methods, which means that you can provide a default implementation for an interface method without forcing all implementing classes to provide their own implementation. Additionally, in C# 9.0 and later, abstract classes can now have implementation for interface members, which means that an abstract class can provide a default implementation for an interface method that derived classes can choose to override or not.

### More About this compare :  

Both abstract classes and interfaces are used to define abstract types in object-oriented programming. Here are some of the main differences between them:

Implementation: An abstract class can contain some implementation code, while an interface cannot. Abstract classes can provide default implementations for some or all of their methods, which can be overridden by subclasses. Interfaces, on the other hand, do not contain any implementation code at all.

Multiple inheritance: A class can only inherit from one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces. This is because an abstract class is a type of class, while an interface is a separate construct that can be implemented by any class.

Accessibility: Methods and fields of an interface are by default public, while an abstract class can have different access modifiers for its methods and fields.

Purpose: Abstract classes are used to define a base class for a group of related classes, while interfaces are used to define a contract that a class must follow.

Constructors: An abstract class can have a constructor, while an interface cannot.

In general, abstract classes are used when you want to create a common base class for a group of related classes, and when you want to provide some default implementation code for those classes. Interfaces, on the other hand, are used when you want to define a contract that a class must follow, but you don't care about its implementation.

It's also worth noting that in some programming languages, such as C#, interfaces can contain default implementations for their methods using default interface methods. This blurs the distinction between interfaces and abstract classes somewhat, but the basic differences outlined above still hold.

**Note** : In last version in C# Interface can contain some implementation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - Abstract method and when can I don't implement abstract method until if inherit abstract class ? with c# example?
An abstract method is a method that does not have an implementation in the base class, and must be implemented in a derived class. To declare an abstract method in C#, you use the abstract keyword before the method signature, like this:

<pre>
public abstract void DoSomething();
Any class that has an abstract method must be declared as an abstract class using the abstract keyword:

public abstract class MyClass
{
    public abstract void DoSomething();
}
</pre>
In this example, MyClass is an abstract class with an abstract method DoSomething(). Any derived class that inherits from MyClass must implement the DoSomething() method, or else it must also be declared as an abstract class.

If you have an abstract class with abstract methods, you can choose to implement some of the methods and leave others as abstract. In this case, any non-abstract methods can provide a default implementation that derived classes can override, while any abstract methods must be implemented by derived classes. Here's an example:
<pre>
public abstract class MyBaseClass
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Doing something in base class");
    }

    public abstract void DoSomethingElse();
}

public class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass
{
    public override void DoSomethingElse()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Doing something else in derived class");
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, MyBaseClass is an abstract class with a non-abstract method DoSomething() and an abstract method DoSomethingElse(). MyDerivedClass is a derived class that inherits from MyBaseClass, and it provides an implementation for the DoSomethingElse() method while inheriting the implementation of the DoSomething() method from the base class.

Note that if you have an abstract method that is not implemented in a derived class, then the derived class must also be declared as an abstract class. If you try to create an instance of a derived class that does not implement all the abstract methods of its base class, you will get a compilation error.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - Different between class and struct ? 
In C#, a class and a struct are two different types of user-defined data structures, each with its own characteristics and uses.

Here are some of the main differences between a class and a struct in C#:

Class is a reference type, whereas struct is a value type. This means that when you create an instance of a class, it is stored in memory and you get a reference to that memory location. When you create an instance of a struct, it is stored on the stack or as part of another object.

Classes support inheritance and polymorphism, while structs do not. This means that you can create a new class that extends or modifies the behavior of an existing class, but you can't do this with structs.

Classes have a default constructor, while structs do not. This means that when you create a new instance of a class, the constructor is called automatically, but you must explicitly call the constructor for a struct.

Classes have nullable types, while structs do not. This means that you can set a reference to a null value, but you can't do this with a value type.

Classes are typically used for larger and more complex data structures that require more memory and processing power, while structs are used for smaller and simpler data structures that require less memory and processing power.

Here's an example of a class in C#:

<pre>
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public void SayHello()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am " + Age + " years old.");
    }
}
</pre>
And here's an example of a struct in C#:
<pre>
public struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, Point is a simple struct with two fields X and Y, and a constructor that takes two arguments to set the values of these fields. Because Point is a value type, when you create a new instance of it, the values of X and Y are stored directly in memory as part of the struct.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - what's Reflection ?
Reflection in C# refers to the ability of a program to examine and analyze its own metadata at runtime. It allows a program to retrieve information about types, methods, properties, and events of an object at runtime.

Here's an example to illustrate how Reflection can be used in C#:

Suppose we have a class Person as follows:

<pre>
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public void PrintDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}");
    }
}
</pre>
We can use Reflection to inspect this class and retrieve information about its properties and methods at runtime. Here's an example of how to do that:
<pre>
using System;
using System.Reflection;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Type type = typeof(Person); // get the type of the Person class

        Console.WriteLine("Properties:");
        foreach (PropertyInfo property in type.GetProperties())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(property.Name);
        }

        Console.WriteLine("\nMethods:");
        foreach (MethodInfo method in type.GetMethods())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(method.Name);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, we use the typeof operator to get the Type object that represents the Person class. We then use this Type object to retrieve information about the class properties and methods using the GetProperties and GetMethods methods. We can then loop through the resulting collections of PropertyInfo and MethodInfo objects and print their names to the console.

This is just a simple example, but Reflection can be used for many other purposes, such as creating objects dynamically, invoking methods dynamically, and more. However, it should be used with caution, as it can have a negative impact on performance and can make code harder to maintain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's Constructor? And What's type of Constructor? 
In C#, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's state by assigning values to its properties and performing any other required setup. The constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

There are several types of constructors in C#, including:

Default constructor: This is a parameterless constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler if no other constructor is defined. It simply initializes the object with default values for its properties.
<pre>
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    // Default constructor
    public Person()
    {
        Name = "Unknown";
        Age = 0;
    }
}
</pre>
Parameterized constructor: This is a constructor that takes one or more parameters and is used to initialize the object with specific values for its properties.
<pre>
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }
}
</pre>
Static constructor: This is a constructor that is called only once, when the class is first accessed. It is used to perform any one-time initialization that is required for the class.
<pre>
public class MyClass
{
    static MyClass()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Static constructor called");
    }
}
</pre>
Private constructor: This is a constructor that is marked as private and is used to prevent the creation of objects of the class by other classes. It is typically used in conjunction with a static factory method to control the creation of objects.
<pre>
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;

    private Singleton()
    {
        // Private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton GetInstance()
    {
        if (_instance == null)
        {
            _instance = new Singleton();
        }

        return _instance;
    }
}
</pre>
These are just a few examples of the types of constructors that are available in C#. Constructors are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming, and they are used extensively in building classes and objects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's Destructor? 
In C#, a destructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to perform any cleanup or finalization that is required before the object is removed from memory.

A destructor is declared in a class using the tilde (~) symbol followed by the class name. It is called automatically by the garbage collector when the object is no longer referenced by any other part of the program. Unlike a constructor, a destructor cannot be called directly.

Here is an example of a destructor:
<pre>
public class MyClass
{
    public MyClass()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Constructor called");
    }

    ~MyClass()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Destructor called");
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, the constructor is called when an object of the class is created, and the destructor is called automatically when the object is about to be destroyed.

It's important to note that the use of destructors in C# is generally discouraged, as they can introduce unnecessary complexity and make it harder to manage memory and resources. Instead, it is generally recommended to use the IDisposable interface and the Dispose() method to perform cleanup and finalization.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q -What's Different between destructor and Finilize and Finally?
In C#, a destructor, finalize method, and finally block are three different constructs that serve different purposes. Here is a brief explanation of each of them:

Destructor:
A destructor is a method that is automatically called by the Garbage Collector (GC) when an object is about to be destroyed. The purpose of the destructor is to release any unmanaged resources that the object may be holding. Unlike in C++, destructors in C# are not used to deallocate memory.

Here's an example of a destructor in C#:
<pre>
public class MyClass
{
    ~MyClass()
    {
        // Release unmanaged resources
    }
}
</pre>
Finalize method:
The finalize method is a method that is called by the GC before an object is garbage collected. Like a destructor, the purpose of the finalize method is to release any unmanaged resources that the object may be holding. However, the finalize method is not guaranteed to be called, and its timing is non-deterministic.

Here's an example of a finalize method in C#:
<pre>
public class MyClass
{
    ~MyClass()
    {
        // Release unmanaged resources
    }
}
</pre>
Finally block:
The finally block is a block of code that is guaranteed to be executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. The purpose of the finally block is to release any resources that may have been acquired in a try block.

Here's an example of a finally block in C#:
<pre>
try
{
    // Do something
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
finally
{
    // Release resources
}
</pre>
In summary, while all three constructs deal with releasing resources, a destructor is used for objects and is called automatically by the GC, a finalize method is also used for objects, but is not guaranteed to be called, and a finally block is used for exception handling and is guaranteed to be executed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What'S Garbge collector?
Garbage Collector (GC) is a feature in many modern programming languages, including C#, Java, and Python, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation for an application. The purpose of the GC is to free the developer from the burden of manually managing memory, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.

The GC works by periodically scanning the heap (the memory space where objects are stored) to identify objects that are no longer being used by the application. These objects are marked as garbage and are eligible for collection. When the GC runs, it frees the memory occupied by the garbage objects and returns it to the system.

The GC in C# is a generational collector, meaning that it divides the heap into three generations: 0, 1, and 2. Newly created objects are placed in generation 0, and if they survive a GC cycle, they are promoted to generation 1, and so on. The GC also uses different algorithms, such as mark-and-sweep, reference counting, and compaction, to manage the heap efficiently.

Although the GC is generally reliable, it's important to note that it's not perfect. For example, it can't collect objects that have circular references or objects that use unmanaged resources, such as file handles or network connections. In these cases, it's necessary to manually release the resources, which can be done using destructors, finalizers, or by implementing the IDisposable interface.

Overall, the GC is a powerful tool that simplifies memory management for developers and reduces the risk of memory leaks and other memory-related issues

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What'S seald class?
In C#, a sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited by other classes. Once a class is marked as sealed, it can no longer serve as a base class for any other class.

Here's an example of a sealed class in C#:
<pre>
public sealed class MySealedClass
{
    // Class members go here
}
</pre>
In this example, the MySealedClass is marked as sealed using the sealed keyword. This means that no other class can inherit from it. If we try to create a class that inherits from MySealedClass, we will get a compile-time error:
<pre>
public class MyDerivedClass : MySealedClass // This will result in a compile-time error
{
    // Class members go here
}
</pre>
Sealing a class is often done for performance reasons, as it allows the compiler to optimize the class more aggressively. It can also be used to prevent unintended inheritance and to enforce a more strict object model.

It's worth noting that although a sealed class cannot be inherited, it can still implement interfaces, and it can still contain virtual methods that can be overridden by its own members.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's Virtual Key?
In C#, a virtual key is a code that represents a physical key on a keyboard. Virtual keys are used to enable the processing of user input, such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, and touch events.

<pre>
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace VirtualKeyExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Listen for key presses
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to see its virtual key code");
            while (true)
            {
                ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
                int virtualKeyCode = (int)keyInfo.Key;
                Console.WriteLine("The virtual key code for {0} is {1}", keyInfo.Key, virtualKeyCode);
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, we use the Console.ReadKey() method to read input from the console. When the user presses a key, the Console.ReadKey() method returns a ConsoleKeyInfo object that contains information about the key that was pressed, including its virtual key code.

To get the virtual key code, we cast the Key property of the ConsoleKeyInfo object to an int value. This value represents the virtual key code of the key that was pressed.

Note that the System.Windows.Forms namespace also provides a Keys enumeration that contains constants for all the virtual keys on a standard keyboard. These constants can be used to simplify the handling of user input in Windows Forms applications.

For example, the following code demonstrates how to handle the KeyPress event of a TextBox control using the Keys enumeration:
<pre>
private void textBox1_KeyPress(object sender, KeyPressEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.KeyChar == (char)Keys.Enter)
    {
        // Handle Enter key press
    }
    else if (e.KeyChar == (char)Keys.Escape)
    {
        // Handle Escape key press
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, we use the Keys enumeration to compare the KeyPressEventArgs.KeyChar property to the virtual key codes for the Enter and Escape keys. If the user presses either of these keys while the TextBox control has focus, the appropriate event handler is called.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - Different between ienumerable and iqueryable ?  
In C#, IEnumerable and IQueryable are two interfaces that are commonly used with LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) to query and manipulate data. While both interfaces are used to represent a collection of data, they have some key differences in terms of their behavior and performance characteristics.

IEnumerable is the simpler of the two interfaces, and it is used to represent a sequence of data that can be enumerated. It defines a single method, GetEnumerator(), which returns an enumerator that can be used to iterate over the sequence.

Here's an example of how to use IEnumerable with LINQ:
<pre>
IEnumerable<string> fruits = new List<string> { "apple", "banana", "orange" };
IEnumerable<string> query = fruits.Where(fruit => fruit.StartsWith("a"));

foreach (string fruit in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
</pre>
In this example, we create an IEnumerable<string> collection of fruits and use the Where method to filter the collection based on a condition. The resulting sequence is stored in an IEnumerable<string> variable, and we use a foreach loop to iterate over the results and print them to the console.

IQueryable, on the other hand, is used to represent a query that can be executed against a data source, such as a database or a web service. It defines methods for building up a query, such as Where, OrderBy, and Select, but unlike IEnumerable, it does not execute the query immediately. Instead, it creates an expression tree that can be translated to the underlying data source and executed there.

Here's an example of how to use IQueryable with LINQ:
<pre>
IQueryable<Product> products = dbContext.Products;
IQueryable<Product> query = products.Where(p => p.Category == "Fruits");

foreach (Product product in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
}
</pre>
In this example, we use an IQueryable<Product> collection to query a database of products. We use the Where method to filter the collection based on a condition, and the resulting expression tree is stored in an IQueryable<Product> variable. When we iterate over the results using a foreach loop, the query is executed against the database and only the matching products are returned.

The main advantage of using IQueryable over IEnumerable is that it allows queries to be executed on the server side, rather than fetching all the data and filtering it on the client side. This can result in significant performance gains for large datasets. However, it's important to note that not all LINQ providers support IQueryable, so it may not be available in all scenarios.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's record in C# 9?
C# 9 introduces a new feature called records, which are a simplified way to define classes that are primarily used to store data. Records provide a concise syntax for defining immutable objects with value semantics, and they can be used to reduce boilerplate code and improve the readability of your code.

Here's an example of how to define a record in C# 9:
<pre>
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName, int Age);
</pre>
In this example, we define a record called Person that has three properties: FirstName, LastName, and Age. The record keyword indicates that this is a record type, and the parentheses define the properties of the record.

One of the key features of records is that they provide built-in support for value-based equality and hashing. This means that two records with the same property values will be considered equal, even if they are different objects. For example:
<pre>
var person1 = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
var person2 = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);

Console.WriteLine(person1 == person2); // True
</pre>
In addition to providing built-in support for equality and hashing, records also generate several other methods and features automatically, including a constructor, deconstructor, ToString() method, and with expression. The with expression is particularly useful, as it allows you to create a new record based on an existing record with one or more properties changed. For example:
<pre>
var person1 = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
var person2 = person1 with { Age = 31 };

Console.WriteLine(person1); // Person { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe, Age = 30 }
Console.WriteLine(person2); // Person { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe, Age = 31 }
</pre>
Overall, records are a powerful and convenient way to define simple classes that are primarily used to store data. They provide many features and benefits out-of-the-box, which can reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write and make your code more concise and readable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's different between class and record in C# 9 ?
In C# 9, records are a new feature that provides a simplified syntax for defining classes that are primarily used to store data. While records share many similarities with classes, there are some key differences between the two.

Here are some of the main differences between classes and records in C# 9:

Mutability: By default, classes are mutable, which means that their properties can be changed after they are instantiated. Records, on the other hand, are immutable by default, which means that their properties cannot be changed after they are created. This makes records well-suited for modeling data that is not meant to be modified once it has been created.

Value-based equality: Records provide built-in support for value-based equality, which means that two records with the same property values are considered equal, even if they are different objects. Classes, on the other hand, do not provide built-in support for value-based equality and must implement the Equals() and GetHashCode() methods to achieve this behavior.

Built-in methods: Records generate several methods automatically, including a constructor, deconstructor, ToString() method, and with expression. Classes do not provide these methods out-of-the-box and must be implemented manually.

Inheritance: Records can inherit from other records or classes, but they cannot be inherited from. Classes can be inherited from and can also inherit from other classes.

Reference types: Classes are reference types, which means that their instances are allocated on the heap and their variables hold references to those instances. Records can be either reference types or value types, depending on their usage.

Overall, while records share many similarities with classes, they are primarily designed for modeling data that is not meant to be modified and can provide a more concise and readable way to define simple data structures. However, classes still have many advantages and may be more appropriate for more complex scenarios.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What is delegate and experssion in C# and how to use it?
In C#, a delegate is a type that represents a method signature. It can be used to reference methods as objects and pass them as parameters to other methods. An expression is a way of writing code that evaluates to a value. In C#, expressions can be used in a variety of contexts, such as assignment statements, method calls, and conditional statements.

Here's an example of using a delegate and expression in C#:

<pre>
using System;

delegate int MyDelegate(int x, int y);

class Program
{
    static int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        MyDelegate del = new MyDelegate(Add);

        int result = del(5, 10);

        Console.WriteLine("Result = " + result);

        Func<int, int, int> expression = (x, y) => x + y;

        result = expression(5, 10);

        Console.WriteLine("Result = " + result);
    }
}
</pre>

In this example, we define a delegate called MyDelegate that takes two int parameters and returns an int value. We also define a method called Add that takes two int parameters and returns their sum.

In the Main method, we create a new instance of the MyDelegate delegate and initialize it with the Add method. We then invoke the delegate with the arguments 5 and 10 and assign the result to a variable called result.

We then print the value of result to the console. The output should be:

<pre>
Result = 15
</pre>

Next, we define an expression using the Func delegate, which is a built-in delegate that takes a specified number of input parameters and returns a value. In this case, the Func delegate takes two int parameters and returns an int value.

The expression we define is a lambda expression that takes two int parameters and returns their sum. We assign the expression to a variable called expression and then invoke it with the arguments 5 and 10 and assign the result to the result variable.

We then print the value of result to the console again. The output should be the same as before:

<pre>
Result = 15
</pre>
This example demonstrates how delegates and expressions can be used to encapsulate method calls and evaluate code at runtime. Delegates can be used to pass methods as parameters to other methods, while expressions can be used to define code that evaluates to a 
value.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q- Different between Pass by refrence and pass by value?
In C#, when passing an argument to a method, it can be done in two ways: "pass by reference" and "pass by value".

When an argument is passed by value, a copy of the argument is created and passed to the method, leaving the original argument unchanged. When an argument is passed by reference, a reference to the original argument is passed to the method, allowing the method to modify the original argument.

Here are examples of both pass by value and pass by reference in C#:

Pass by Value:
<pre>
static void Main(string[] args) {
    int a = 5;
    IncrementByValue(a);
    Console.WriteLine(a); // Output: 5
}

static void IncrementByValue(int b) {
    b++;
}
</pre>
In this example, the method IncrementByValue takes an integer argument b by value. The Main method initializes an integer a to 5 and calls the IncrementByValue method, passing in a. When IncrementByValue is called, a copy of the value of a is made and passed to the method. b is then incremented by 1, but the original value of a remains unchanged. When the program prints a to the console, it still outputs 5.

Pass by Reference:
<pre>
static void Main(string[] args) {
    int a = 5;
    IncrementByRef(ref a);
    Console.WriteLine(a); // Output: 6
}

static void IncrementByRef(ref int b) {
    b++;
}
</pre>
In this example, the method IncrementByRef takes an integer argument b by reference, indicated by the ref keyword. The Main method initializes an integer a to 5 and calls the IncrementByRef method, passing in a with the ref keyword. When IncrementByRef is called, a reference to the original value of a is passed to the method. b is then incremented by 1, modifying the original value of a. When the program prints a to the console, it now outputs 6.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q- When equal refrence object to refrence object and same in case value?
When working with objects in C#, it is important to understand the difference between reference types and value types.

Reference types are types that are stored in memory as a reference to an object, rather than as the actual value of the object. When you create a new instance of a reference type, a new object is created in memory, and a reference to that object is returned. Any variables that reference the same object will have the same value.

Value types, on the other hand, are types that are stored in memory as the actual value of the object, rather than as a reference to the object. When you create a new instance of a value type, a new copy of the object is created in memory. Any variables that reference the same value will have different memory locations.

Here's an example of creating reference and value types in C#:

<pre>
// Creating a reference type
class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

Person person1 = new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
Person person2 = person1;

// Changing the value of a property in person1 also changes it in person2
person1.Name = "Jane";
Console.WriteLine(person2.Name); // Output: "Jane"


// Creating a value type
int x = 5;
int y = x;

// Changing the value of x does not affect the value of y
x = 10;
Console.WriteLine(y); // Output: 5
</pre>
In the above example, we create a reference type called Person and a value type called int. We then create two variables for each type, and assign the value of one variable to the other.

For the reference type Person, when we change the value of a property in person1, it also changes the value in person2, since they are both references to the same object.

For the value type int, when we change the value of x, it does not affect the value of y, since they are both separate values.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design patterns:**
### 1- What's Design Pattern?
A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a particular context in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a particular problem that can be adapted and reused in different situations. Design patterns are like templates or blueprints for building software that help developers solve common problems in an efficient and effective way.

Design patterns can be categorized into three main groups: creational, structural, and behavioral. Creational patterns are concerned with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Structural patterns deal with object composition, forming class hierarchies, and defining how objects are composed to form larger structures. Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication between objects, encapsulating behaviors and interactions between objects.

The use of design patterns can provide several benefits, such as reducing the time and effort needed to solve common problems, improving code readability and maintainability, facilitating communication between team members, and promoting code reusability. There are many well-known design patterns, such as the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Observer pattern, Decorator pattern, and many more.
<small>
By understanding and applying design patterns, developers can create more robust, maintainable, and extensible software that can better meet the needs of their users. However, it's important to note that design patterns should be used judiciously and only where appropriate. Overuse or misuse of design patterns can lead to unnecessarily complex and difficult-to-maintain code.

## **General Topics:**




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3- What is Casting and type of casting in C#?
Casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another in C#. There are several types of casting that you can use to convert values:

Implicit Casting: This is when the compiler automatically converts a value from one type to another, if it can be done safely. For example, you can implicitly cast an int to a double, because there is no loss of precision.

Explicit Casting: This is when you explicitly tell the compiler to convert a value from one type to another. Explicit casting requires the use of a cast operator, which is a set of parentheses containing the target type. For example, you can explicitly cast a double to an int by using the cast operator, like this: (int)3.14.

Boxing: This is the process of converting a value type to a reference type, by wrapping the value type in an object. For example, you can box an int by assigning it to an object, like this: object obj = 42;.

Unboxing: This is the process of extracting the value from a boxed object and converting it back to a value type. For example, you can unbox an int by casting the object to an int, like this: int i = (int)obj;.

Here's an example of casting in C#:

<pre>
// Implicit Casting
int x = 5;
double y = x; // No cast operator required

// Explicit Casting
double a = 3.14;
int b = (int)a; // Cast operator required

// Boxing
int c = 42;
object obj = c; // Boxing c into an object

// Unboxing
int d = (int)obj; // Casting obj back to an int
</pre>
In the above example, we use implicit casting to convert an int to a double, and explicit casting to convert a double to an int. We also demonstrate boxing by assigning an int to an object, and unboxing by casting the object back to an int.

Casting is a powerful tool in C#, but it should be used with care, as it can lead to unexpected results if not used properly. It is important to understand the limitations of each type of casting, and to be mindful of potential data loss or type mismatches when converting values.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4- object obj = null; 
### - int d = (int)obj;
### - int d = obj as int ;
### - int d = Int64.Parse(obj);
### - int d = Int64.TryParse(obj)
### - int d = obj is int ;
### What happend in all this cases ?
In the following code, obj is declared as a null object reference of type object:

<pre>
object obj = null;
Now, let's take a look at what happens in each of the scenarios you provided:

int d = (int)obj;: This is an explicit cast that attempts to convert the null reference obj to an int. This will result in a System.NullReferenceException at runtime, because you cannot cast a null reference to a value type like int.

int d = obj as int;: This is a safe cast that attempts to convert obj to an int, but instead of throwing an exception if the cast fails, it returns null. Since obj is a null reference, the result of this cast will also be null. The resulting value of d will be 0 (the default value for int), because the variable was not assigned any other value.

int d = Int64.Parse(obj);: This is an attempt to parse the null reference obj as a long value using the Int64.Parse method. This will result in a System.ArgumentNullException at runtime, because Int64.Parse does not accept null arguments.

int d = Int64.TryParse(obj, out long result);: This is an attempt to parse the null reference obj as a long value using the Int64.TryParse method. This method is a safe way to convert a string to a long value, because it returns true if the parse succeeded and false if it failed. Since obj is a null reference, the parse will fail and the value of d will be 0 (the default value for int), because the out parameter result will not be assigned any other value.

int d = obj is int;: This is a type check that returns false, because obj is not an instance of int. The resulting value of d will be false, which is a bool value.
</pre>
In general, it's important to be careful when casting, parsing or checking the type of null references, because these operations can throw exceptions or return unexpected results. It's a good practice to check if an object is null before attempting to cast, parse or use it, to avoid null reference exceptions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q - What's Ref key and out Key in C# ?
In C#, ref and out are keywords that are used to pass arguments by reference in a method call. Here's what each of them does:

ref keyword: The ref keyword is used to pass a parameter by reference to a method. This means that any changes made to the parameter inside the method will be reflected outside the method as well. The variable passed with ref must be initialized before it is passed.
Here's an example:

<pre>
public void Increment(ref int x)
{
    x++;
}

int num = 5;
Increment(ref num);
// num will now be 6
</pre>
In this example, the Increment method takes an int parameter x by reference using the ref keyword. When we pass the variable num to this method with ref, any changes made to x inside the method will be reflected in the num variable outside the method.

out keyword: The out keyword is similar to ref, but it is used for returning values from a method rather than passing them as input. The out parameter does not need to be initialized before it is passed.
Here's an example:
<pre>
public void Divide(int x, int y, out int quotient, out int remainder)
{
    quotient = x / y;
    remainder = x % y;
}

int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 3;
int result, remainder;
Divide(num1, num2, out result, out remainder);
// result will be 3 and remainder will be 1
</pre>
In this example, the Divide method takes two integer parameters x and y and uses the out keyword to return two integer values quotient and remainder. When we call this method, we pass the result and remainder variables with the out keyword. After the method call, these variables will contain the values of quotient and remainder, respectively.

Note that when using out, the method must assign a value to the output parameter before the method returns, otherwise the code will not compile.

## Database 
### 1- What is isolations levels?
In database management systems, isolation levels are a set of rules that determine how transactions interact with each other and with the underlying data. Isolation levels define the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from other transactions and how the changes made by one transaction can be seen by other transactions.

There are several isolation levels defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL standard, and most relational database management systems support at least some of them. The most common isolation levels are:

Read Uncommitted: The lowest isolation level, where transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.

Read Committed: Transactions can only see committed changes made by other transactions.

Repeatable Read: Transactions are guaranteed to see the same data throughout the transaction, even if other transactions make changes to the data.

Serializable: The highest isolation level, where transactions are completely isolated from each other, and appear to be executed one after the other.

Snapshot: A non-standard isolation level, where each transaction sees a snapshot of the data at the beginning of the transaction, and any changes made by other transactions are ignored.

The choice of isolation level depends on the specific requirements of the application and the database. Higher isolation levels provide greater transaction safety, but also reduce concurrency and can lead to increased blocking and reduced performance. Lower isolation levels can provide higher concurrency and better performance, but may lead to data inconsistencies and concurrency problems.

It is important for developers and database administrators to understand the various isolation levels and choose the appropriate one for their application to ensure that transactions are processed correctly and data integrity is maintained.

## Software Architecture

### 1-What is DDD? (Domain-Driven Design)
DDD stands for Domain-Driven Design, which is an approach to software development that emphasizes the importance of understanding the domain or business problem that the software is meant to solve. DDD is based on the idea that the domain is the most important part of a software system, and that the design of the system should be driven by the domain.

DDD provides a set of principles and patterns that can help developers to create software that is more closely aligned with the business problem it is meant to solve. 

One of the key benefits of DDD is that it can help to create a shared understanding of the domain between business stakeholders and technical team members. This shared understanding can help to reduce the risk of miscommunication and ensure that the software system meets the needs of the business.

DDD is not a specific technology or tool, but rather a set of principles and practices that can be applied to any software development project. However, there are tools and frameworks available that can help to implement DDD concepts in practice, such as event sourcing, CQRS, and domain-specific languages.
